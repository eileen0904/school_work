    Write a Java program that can read information from input.xml and write this information into the class table in XMLDB database.
  - lab2
  
    Write a Java program that can read records from the class table in the XMLDB 
database and write these records into an XML file named test.xml. Upload java 
source codes on the e-learning system after finishing this work.
